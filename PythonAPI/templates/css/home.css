/*
    This is the "home.css" page specific CSS3 override file
    Use this to write custom CSS3 code that will be accessible to "home.html" only

    ---------Standards and Best Practices-------------------
    -- 1. Make sure to always copy and paste this header to each *.js,*.css file to map the important functionality
    -- 2. Use the page specific code sparingly, do your best to write relative Dynamic code - will save time and energy
    -- 3. When reaching Production please "minify" all js/css files to eliminate comments and condense the files
    -- 4. "Min" file naming pattern should be as follows:
            Page specific - "[name].min.[version #].[js/css]"
            Main files    - "main.min.[version #].[js/css]"
    -- 5. Please remove this file from the production version to keep file structure integrity and security reasons
